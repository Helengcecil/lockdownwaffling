<h1>Lockdown Waffling</h1>

<h2>Waffling recommences</h2>
<p> As Helen logged off after her last lesson, delighted to have reached half term, 
she stated her desire to make a to do list for her week off. Top of the list: make waffles. </p>
<p> It is of some debate between the two of us as to whether fun things should be on to do lists. 
I’d argue it adds pressure to what should be relaxing affairs; Helen finds joy in the ticking off 
of tasks. I maintain that life should not be a to do list but let her keep waffles on the list as 
it’s her life she’s ruining, not mine.</p>
<p> And so there we were just adjusting to the calmer holiday vibes, clearly no tension whatsoever, 
when an email of great panic landed in our inboxes. </p>
<p> The sender, an avid blog-reader, had been vigilantly waiting for a new post on here. Not knowing 
the general pattern of these things happening more out of school term time, and after hearing rumours 
of maggots in our dwelling place, seeing no sign of us being alive through church ‘broadcasts’ and my 
absence from homegroup last week being noted, the poor reader was pretty much left fearing for our lives. </p>
<p> I think part of the problem, aside from the unfortunate timings of other incidents, was the 
interpretation of the word ‘soon’. It seems that some take that to mean far sooner than I mean. I take a 
wider view of life. What’s five years in a lifetime?! Helen and I have often had similar debates regarding 
my gathering of possessions. ‘Are you going to use the dehydrator much, Laura?’, ‘Yes’. A few months down 
the line: ‘I knew you’d use it a couple of times and forget about it.’. No, it’s a life-long joy! And I 
shall yet use it again! </p>
<p> But anyway, the email prompted us to get a move on with the waffles. We went with a potato and carrot 
option - complete with much cheese. It was very good and stuck together much better than our last potato 
waffle attempt, probably thanks to the addition of eggs. We enjoyed some roasted asparagus and peppers on top. </p>
<p> The best part however had to be Helen’s removal of the waffle from the iron, as seen in the second photo. 
It should be noted that the power was still very much on. But apparently I should help rather than take photos....</p>
<p> I feel I must speak a little further of these maggots. I won’t say too much given the vileness of the things 
but let’s just say purple and lots. They were under and around the bin. The bin is now being kept outside our 
French windows. The cleaner and her leaf blower (why, why, we ask is she using a leaf blower as part of the 
cleaning package - so unnecessary) seemed a little startled by its appearance, before blowing leaves into it. </p>
<p> We aren’t in any rush to bring the bin back inside. Meanwhile there’s been a plague of flies in the flat. 
Helen has secretly been enjoying killing them off one by one. Or at least I’ve been enjoying watching her. 
There’s an hilariously sudden movement after she sprays it as she darts to the floor to get it while it’s down. </p>
<p> But now I’m happy to say the flat seems plague free and we’re expecting to make sweet waffles tomorrow. </p>
