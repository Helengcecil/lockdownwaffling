<h2>Waffling becomes a habit</h2>
<p> Well, we quickly came to our senses and got started on the 
sweet waffles. We had to wait till the following day on account 
of how filling the first waffles were. I think the problem had 
been the vast quantity of the savoury topping we’d consumed. 
As a result, poor Helen was left wondering whether she’d even 
manage one whole sweet waffle. </p>
<p> She did, of course. Strawberries and melted Dairy Milk went 
down very well. I believe we may even have managed another half 
waffle each. The lockdown supply of 720g of chocolate was 
rapidly worked through. </p>
<p> And so the week progressed with the delight of waffles 
getting us through. We learnt that we don’t require lunch to 
contain any savoury part; a sweet waffle will always do just 
fine. <br> 
Excellently, in fact. </p>
