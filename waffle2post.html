<h1>Lockdown Waffling</h1>

<h2>Waffling becomes a habit</h2>
<p> Well, we quickly came to our senses and got started on the 
sweet waffles. We had to wait till the following day on account 
of how filling the first waffles were. I think the problem had 
been the vast quantity of the savoury topping we’d consumed. 
As a result, poor Helen was left wondering whether she’d even 
manage one whole sweet waffle. </p>
<p> She did, of course. Strawberries and melted Dairy Milk went 
down very well. I believe we may even have managed another half 
waffle each. The lockdown supply of 720g of chocolate was 
rapidly worked through. </p>
<p> And so the week progressed with the delight of waffles 
getting us through. We learnt that we don’t require lunch to 
contain any savoury part; a sweet waffle will always do just 
fine. <br> 
Excellently, in fact. </p>
<p> I would have stopped writing there but apparently that’s not 
  proper waffling. So let me continue my waffling and tell you about 
  other events of lockdown. </p>
<p> I’m going out only for exercise. There’s some good areas of grass 
  and woodland nearby that I like to frequent on my daily walk. The only 
  trouble is that dog owners (complete with their dogs) also like to 
  take regular visits to the same places. I really dislike dogs, mainly 
  because I can’t cope with the idea of what germs they might be carrying. 
  But dogs seem to really like me. </p>
<p> I will be standing there, clearly fearing for my life as a dog jumps 
  at me and if the owner has even realised, they’ll say something like 
  ‘Oh, don’t worry, she won’t hurt you.’ </p>
<p> If only I were bolder, I’d say what I’m screaming in my head, ‘The 
  problem is that she’s contaminating me!!’. </p>
<p> The first time this happened during lockdown, as the creature attacked 
  me, I panicked about it carrying coronavirus. I say I was attacked; it was 
  more of a leaping and licking carry on. But I was not okay about it. </p>
<p> After consulting a knowledgeable source, I was convinced that I could not 
  have contracted coronavirus from this interaction. But you know, I kind of 
  wish you could… then maybe people would watch their dogs more closely and 
  protect the likes of me! </p>
<p> Helen suggests I don’t go to the fields where dogs are most likely to be. 
  Perhaps a better way to deal with it, but can I just say, what is with the 
  dog poo everywhere?! It’s like coronavirus hits and people don't think they 
  need to clean up after their dog. It’s vile. </p>
<p> Turns out I feel quite strongly about that. But let me tell you how affected 
  my subconscious is by it all… </p>
<p> I was just innocently sleeping the night away when I found myself falling 
  into a dream. A nice enough dream with a coastal cottage, seagulls in the 
  background and blue summer skies. But then enter a dog. A big, black, ominous 
  creature. I am left alone with it. I try to politely request it stay away from 
  me. No, it isn’t having that. I panic and try kicking it back (please don’t tell 
  the RSPCA!). It carries on at me. Who knows whether it was infecting me or 
  hurting me, but either way, the dream blurred into a nightmare of darkness and 
  dog-hatred. </p>
<p> Next morning, Helen greets me with a question - I’m used to finding out I’ve 
  been screaming during the night, but this one surprises me - ‘Why were you banging
  on the walls in the night?’. </p>
  <p> Ah. Yes. That’ll have been the dog-kicking. </p>
<p> Dear Future Husband, you might not want to go sharing a bed with me. You also 
  may not have any positive feelings towards dogs or at least, kindly suppress them. 
  But I’m not a bad housemate otherwise, at least I think that’s what Helen mostly 
  thinks. Probably. All my future love, Laura </p>
