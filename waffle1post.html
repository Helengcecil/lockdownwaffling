<h1>Lockdown Waffling</h1>

<h2>The waffling begins...</h2>
<p> It was Monday 23rd March when lockdown slammed down into our lives. </p>
<p> Sometimes it's easier to deal with smaller, more tangible matters like missed 
holidays than the thought of the incomprehensible quagmires such as navigating 
life in lockdown while microorganisms rip the world apart. And I guess that’s 
what happened with us. We had been forced to cancel our upcoming trip to Brussels 
and miss out on the local delicacies of Belgium. </p>
<p> That is to say, we weren’t getting any waffles. </p>
<p> Not even one. </p>
<p> The fix to this? A quick search on the internet and voila, nouveau waffle maker! </p>
<p> Over the days and weeks that followed, we would find ourselves to be very grateful 
for the joy this small machine could bring into our lives during the dreary days stuck 
inside. </p>
<p> Helen is becoming quite the experienced waffle maker. Meanwhile, Laura has a talent 
for waffling (sometimes also known as a struggle with conciseness). Together, we are 
uniting (interestingly, ‘uniting’ is not recognised as a word by the first edition of 
Words with Friends - see how we have been entertaining ourselves) in our waffling to form 
this blog. </p>
<p> We hope you enjoy it as we document our experiences of waffles and locked down lives! </p>
<p> For some bizarre reason, we opted for our first waffle to be a savoury one. A savoury 
waffle?! My reaction mirrors Miranda’s upon hearing that Gary’s muffins are, in fact, not 
sweet ones. </p>
<p> Having said that, I did really enjoy this one. It featured roasted butternut squash, 
mozzarella and some homemade pesto (a blitzing of frozen garlic, basil, olive oil and 
pecorino). The batter, having a fair amount of sugar in, is probably more designed for a 
sweet experience. </p>
