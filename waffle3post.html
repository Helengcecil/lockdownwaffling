<h2>Waffling changes</h2>
<p> ‘Shut up, Laura!’ I exclaimed one evening after what was maybe my millionth moment 
of bursting into song for all of two seconds a time. </p>
<p>‘Yeah, shut up, Laura’ Helen joked. It’s getting ridiculous. I mean, I drive myself 
mad, I don’t know how she doesn’t lose it with me. She sometimes looks up from what she’s 
doing, over at me in my seat across the room and asks what I just said. ‘Oh I’m just quoting’ 
I’ll say, like it's a normal thing to randomly do at any time one likes. Like it's not the 
most annoying thing for her.</p>
<p> My waffling has recently begun to turn more into a variety of lines or part lines from 
songs I didn't even know were in my brain. Largely nursery rhymes. It is always encouraging 
to discover that’s the kind of thing my subconscious is most familiar with. There's also the 
fun out-of-tune humming that happens in a somewhat similar vein, except, without lyrics, 
there's little to give away what on earth the intended song is. </p>
<p> Helen’s waffling, however, has been somewhat more of a success. Having got quite used to 
the making of ordinary waffles, she got adventurous and put cake mixture into the iron! It 
worked very nicely, especially combined with the chocolate-condensed milk sauce she concocted. </p>
<p> Inspired by ‘Best Home Cook’, we’d each ordered the other some ingredients to make either 
a main course or dessert with. I’d got Helen some condensed milk (one of my favourite foods ever) 
and a packet of frozen berries. She was allowed to use anything we had in the cupboards to 
create her pudding. </p>
<p> Before long, her chocolate cake mix - complete with condensed milk - was ready and into 
the waffle maker it went. </p>
<p> Of course there was still the mass of chocolate in the cupboard. So that was melted with 
the rest of the condensed milk. It was, as I mentioned, delightful. Thick though. (When we 
repeated the recipe the next day, we did add a bit of butter to the sauce which aided the 
runniness.) I’d highly recommend it. </p>
<p> It certainly shut me up for a while. </p>
