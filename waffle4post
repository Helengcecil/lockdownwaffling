<h2>Extravagant waffling</h2>
<p> Writing in a self-deprecating style may add comic value but I wouldn't want anybody to 
think that I am the only one in the flat who makes us laugh. No, Helen does her fair share 
of accidental entertaining. For example, she’s quite the pro at spilling food or drink on 
herself, the carpet, her laptop.... But it would seem wrong for me to detail other hilarious 
moments that could be taken at her expense. So just know I’m not the only one who can act 
crazy in this household!  </p>
<p> Bearing in mind my obvious kindness there, I’m hoping I can get away with the following 
telling of a waffle-related tale. </p>
<p> Rob has very sweetly been bringing us various essential items whilst we are locked in. 
He’s always careful to leave things outside and the poor star-crossed pair have to talk 
through the door. This always makes me think of Peter Quince’s ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’. I so 
want to cast myself as the wall. Although, maybe, in reality, I really wouldn’t. </p>
<p> An unexpected appearance of Rob the other night left me confused. Helen seemed unfazed. 
Apparently not everyone has to know exactly what’s going on. Helen disappeared to the door. </p>
<p> Moments later she was back. With a bag. A bag full of eggs. Maybe 200 of the things?! OK, 
a lot of them were mini eggs or enchanted eggs, but the excitement was huge. And in case anyone 
doubted it, this was very much an essential delivery for morale. </p>
<p> ‘Would you like a waffle, Rob?’ asked Helen, now on the phone to him outside. You see, we 
had had some for lunch and made a whole batch. </p>
<p> I sprung to my feet, quite uncharacteristically, and started melting, grating and crushing 
four different types of chocolate (milk, white, dark and a caramel egg - we were already 
worryingly well stocked with these crucial groceries). I took great delight in arranging these 
and the banana Helen had chopped on the reheated waffle. </p>
<p> Rob reckoned I was doing a Sheldon. He’d given me an amazing gift so now I felt I must give 
him one back. Thankfully, I don’t put a price on my time so, without leaving the house, it was 
pretty hard to match the exact worth of his gift. I wondered what the worth of my time was. Does 
one base that on salary? £0, then. But I see all sorts of issues with that model, not least the 
implication that some people are worth more than others. This left me pondering for a while. </p>
<p> I actually felt that, unlike Sheldon, I was acting out of my gratitude to Rob. Christians 
aren’t saved by doing good but when someone becomes a Christian, they want to live for Jesus 
because they are so thankful that he has already saved them. I wished that my response to Jesus’s 
ultimate sacrifice spurred me on so visibly as this bag of chocolate eggs. Let me assure the reader 
though that in general life, I find a lot more hope in Jesus than any amount of chocolate! </p>
<p> Anyway, Rob enjoyed his waffle I believe. I’m quite tempted to try one like it myself... </p>
